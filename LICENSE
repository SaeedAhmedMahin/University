Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software
and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses
are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a programâ€”to make sure it remains free software for all
its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the term "free
software" to refer to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses
are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs,
and that you are informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

For the developers' and authors' sake, the GPL ensures that everyone
else is also permitted to copy, distribute and modify the software.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

   This License refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
   The "Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations. To "modify" a
   work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
   fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
   exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
   the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work. A "covered
   work" means either the unmodified Program or a modified version.
   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on
   a computer or modifying it. To "convey" a work means any kind of
   propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.
   Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no
   transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
   to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently
   visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice,
   and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work
   (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees
   may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of
   this License.

1. Source Code.

   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
   for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source
   form of a work. A "Standard Interface" means an interface that
   either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards
   body, or, in the absence of such a standard, is widely used among
   developers working in the same field as the Program.

   The source code for a work is not the same as the object code. The
   source code must be made available to the user in a form that is
   suitable for modification. The object code must be made available
   in
